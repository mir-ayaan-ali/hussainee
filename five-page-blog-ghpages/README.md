- Desktop shows **4 tiles per row**, mobile shows **1 tile per row**.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages (HashRouter)

1. Replace `REPO_NAME` in `vite.config.js` with your repository name (e.g., `/five-page-blog/`).
2. Commit and push to the `main` branch on GitHub.
3. In **Settings â†’ Pages**, set **Source** to **GitHub Actions** (or it will auto-detect after first run).
4. The included workflow builds the site and deploys the `/dist` folder to Pages automatically.
5. Your live URL will be `https://<your-username>.github.io/REPO_NAME/`.

*Routing note:* This project uses **HashRouter**, so URLs like `#/blog/1` will work on Pages without extra redirects.
